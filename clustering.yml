# configure the worker nodes and initialize the cluster
#This playbook contains the instructions that have to be executed on worker nodes.
#With the second replay, a single task executes the join command on all worker nodes.
#At the end of this activity, the two worker nodes will be part of the cluster.
#Save and close the file when done and run the playbook by running locally
# : ansible-playbook -i hosts workers.yml
