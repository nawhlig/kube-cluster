# configure the worker nodes and initialize the cluster
#This playbook contains the instructions that have to be executed on worker nodes.
#With the second replay, a single task executes the join command on all worker nodes.
#At the end of this activity, the two worker nodes will be part of the cluster.
#Save and close the file when done and run the playbook by running locally
# : ansible-playbook -i hosts workers.yml

# Note: if you prefer to use Flannel CNI plugin instead of Calico, it suffices to replace that part with:
#   - With the fourth task, you are running Kubectl apply to install Flannel.
#     kubectl apply -f descriptor. [yml | json] is the syntax for telling Kubectl to create the objects described in the descriptor file. [yml | json].
#     The kube-flannel.yml file contains descriptions of the objects needed to configure Flannel in the cluster.
